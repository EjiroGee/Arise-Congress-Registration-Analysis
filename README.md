# ARISE Congress 2.0 Data Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing registration and participation trends for the forthcoming **Arise Congress 2.0** of the Nigeria Baptist Convention.  
The goal was to provide a clear, interactive, and data-driven dashboard to assist organizers in understanding attendee demographics, payment preferences, and conference distribution.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Data Source & Collection
The dataset was sourced from the official Arise Congress registration platform (**reg.ariseforimpact.org**) using **[Apify](https://apify.com/)** for web scraping.  
This enabled extraction of structured and up-to-date information while ensuring completeness and accuracy.

## ðŸ›  Data Cleaning & Preparation
The raw scraped data contained inconsistencies and redundancies, which were addressed using **Power Query** in Microsoft Excel.

### Key Cleaning Steps:
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
- Standardized location names, payment methods, and registration types.
- Converted dates, numeric fields, and categorical values into analysis-ready formats.

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Process
Data summarization was done with **Pivot Tables** to:
- Categorize registrants by **gender**.
- Group registrations by **type** (Bulk vs. Personal).
- Break down **payment methods** (Bank Transfer vs. Card).
- Rank top conferences by number of registrants.
- Analyze participation history in **Arise Congress 1.0**.
